# 3D-Raycaster

Wolfenstein 3D like raycaster with Rust and Macroquad


## TODO

- Textures
    - Multiple textures
        - Texture atlas:
            - map contains more than just 0, 1
            - 0 = empty, 1..n = wall with texture n
            - source y = nth in texture atlas;
            - source x = ray_hit.wall_coord
- Fix column widths
- Hitboxes on walls
- Sprites?
